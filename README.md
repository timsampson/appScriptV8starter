This is a starter project for web app which uses clasp to deploy modern Javascript to Google's Apps Script (GAS) projects V8 engine.  It includes the starter template for [Bootstrap 5](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/), which I am currently using in projects.  I've included the sticky footer because it seems I always scratch my head to figure out how to setup the stickly footer each time. If you want to dive deeper and encorporate Google Sheets, you should  watch this Youtube tutorial on Google Sheets being used as a backend for an Apps Script Web App by [Learn Google Spreadsheets on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9Pf9aNgemt82hBENyneRyHnD-zORB3l).

I am finding it difficult to keep up with tsconfig, eslint (tslint) and the defaults.  It may not matter for a simple site, but I will use this repository to keep track of the optimal options to get started with modern Javascript features in the V8 engine, the web and use Typescript in development. If you find this helpful, that is a bonus.
